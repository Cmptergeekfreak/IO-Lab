Lab #1 Instructions
======================================================
Create a text file using Notepad++ or your favorite text editor. Place the 
file in “C:\temp\lab1” if using Windows O/S. If using a Macintosh, place the file 
in “/Users/<yourUserName>\Documents”. The file name should end in “.txt”. 
Enter data representing a small mailing list. Format exactly as follows (each 
group of 3 lines is one record, create at least 3 records): 
FirstName LastName
Street Address
City, State Zipcode
… now read each record from the file and output to the console. Once you’ve 
successfully shown that you can read data from a file, append one or two new 
records using write techniques
